# Webstack - Portfolio Project

# Introduction

The increasing demand for user-friendly, feature-rich e-commerce platforms has become viral whether it's Amazon, Walmart, or Shopify everyone is shifting to become a self-hosted e-commerce platform to sell and arrange better goods online without annoying customers to visit physical shops to purchase anything.

# My Project : MARSIITO Store

I believe that technology can solve anything so I started learning about it and eventually got into web development at ALX. I chose React JS to build something to practice my skills while gaining a deep understanding of the core concepts of React JS & its entire ecosystem.
I wanted to build some real-world applications so that recruiters and other people could relate to them easily therefore I developed MARSIITO Store, a basic E-commerce platform to utilize the power of React JS.

# Project Goals

The goal was to dig deeper by coding a lot into it. I intend to showcase the capabilities of React JS, React Router v6, Context API, MockBee, TailwindCSS, React Hot Toast, and integrate features like product listings, sorting/filtering, authentication, cart/wishlist management, payment processing, and purchase history.

# Project Structure and Key Features 

I wanted to use industry-level best practices by separating the projects into folders and the folder structure is as follows:
The SRC folder: As you all know React JS has a separate source (src) folder that contains all the logic and UI parts and by combining everything we link everything to the main App JS FILE which serves the index.html file It also the main source file.
The Component Folder: Components are a small amount of UI for the entire page instead of making the same component repetitively if it is being used multiple times we create it once and call it anywhere on any page.
The Context Folder: The context Folder is responsible for managing the states in the entire application it helps to clean the code separately and create the files and folders concerning the feature we are building.
The Pages Folder: Pages are nothing different than other web pages in React JS instead of building the entire pages in one go we break the pages into smaller components.
The Services Folder: The services folder contains all the backend data which can be hosted as a JSON file or it can also be retrieved from an API.
The UTILS Folder: Utils or utility folder generally contains the main or supported libraries code in one file making your code much cleaner and easy to read and understand.

# Decoding Page Structure 

My Project contains multiple pages as I have also implanted dynamic routing enabling users to see the product details in separate pages.
I have added the following pages to my work
1.     Landing or Homepage to showcase what I am offering
2.     Product Listing Page to display how many products I have along with their values and a sidebar section to filter out the products based on their price, rating & availability
3.     Dynamic Product Listing page for each product
4.     Cart Page along with the checkout button you can also increase and decrease the quantity of product and remove it as well from the cart
5.     Order & address manager page with the option to add an address and proceed with payment.
6.     Order Confirmation page that your order has been received successfully.
7.     Wishlist page to add products for future reference.
8.     Profile manager page where you can see the order you have purchased, the address you have added, and your profile information under the separate tabs.
9.     Authentication page for user login and signup along with mock login credentials.
